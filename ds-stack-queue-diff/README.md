Please write your explanation below.




//the ansower

queue is an  a line sequence values ,, like the first element we add from the end  is the first element that will out from the front..
and ,, the last elemnt we add is the last element will git out..
example : like if we want to stand in arrow and buy something we cant step over the people and so if we are standing in last of the line we have to wait till all of the people pass ..


stack its like row with one open ,, so the first element that we add is the last element that git out ,, and the last element that we add os the first element that will get out..
example : if we want to arrange some of the books ,, so the first book we will take is the last book that we put it ..
